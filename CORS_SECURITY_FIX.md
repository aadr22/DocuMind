# CORS Security Fix

## What Was Fixed

**Issue**: The backend API had CORS configured to allow requests from ANY origin (`allow_origins=["*"]`), which is a critical security vulnerability.

**Risk**: Any malicious website could:
- Make requests to your API
- Steal user data
- Perform unauthorized actions
- Launch CSRF attacks

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment-Based CORS Configuration

The CORS middleware now:
- Uses the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Defaults to localhost-only in development
- Requires explicit configuration for production

### 2. Restricted HTTP Methods

Changed from allowing ALL methods (`["*"]`) to specific ones:
- `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`

### 3. Restricted Headers

Changed from allowing ALL headers (`["*"]`) to specific ones:
- `Content-Type`, `Authorization`, `Accept`

## Configuration

### Development (Local)

In `backend/env.local`:
```bash
# Leave empty for localhost defaults, or explicitly set:
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

This automatically allows:
- `http://localhost:3000`
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

### Production (Deployed)

Set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable to your frontend domain(s):

**Single domain:**
```bash
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

**Multiple domains (comma-separated):**
```bash
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app,https://www.your-app.com,https://app.your-domain.com
```

## Testing

After this fix, the backend will:
1. Log allowed origins on startup: `CORS configured with origins: [...]`
2. Only accept requests from configured domains
3. Return CORS errors for unauthorized origins

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Update CORS configuration in code
- [x] Update env.local for development
- [x] Update env_example.txt with documentation
- [ ] Set ALLOWED_ORIGINS in production environment (Render/Railway/Vercel)
- [ ] Test CORS from production frontend
- [ ] Verify unauthorized origins are blocked

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Render
1. Dashboard → Environment Variables
2. Add: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app`

### Railway
1. Project → Variables
2. Add: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app`

### Heroku
```bash
heroku config:set ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### Docker
Add to docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
environment:
  - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

## Impact

✅ **Security**: Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests  
✅ **Flexibility**: Easy to configure per environment  
✅ **Clarity**: Explicit logging of allowed origins  
✅ **Compatibility**: Maintains all required functionality

## Notes

- The frontend at `http://localhost:3000` will continue to work in development
- Production deployment requires setting the environment variable
- Multiple domains can be added as comma-separated values
- HTTPS is recommended for all production origins
